            <h2></h2>
            <p> the only person on your mind like your the only person on mine. i wanted you! all of you, the secrets, the hugs, the late night face time calls, the forehead kisses. but when your friend zoned me you ripped out my heart, stomped on it and left me hurting, wondering why i wasn't good enough and why i was always the second choice, the back up that nobody looked twice at. you will never know how much you truly mean to me. but THAT'S OKAY im used to it.</p>

            <p> your smile,your eyes. i can't get over your cute as  messy hair your questionable choice in fashion. i love your caring personality and the way that you actuallly listen to my problems and give me advice. ilove that  i can come to you about anything and you can come to me with anything. i can't get over how fast my heart beats when i see you look at me. but you only look at her now . we're still amazing friends, but i wanted more than that. i wanted to be the your one and only one.</p>

            <p>its okay when your expectaations.your dreams and your hope lead to disappointment, painful,difficult and sad,but okay.it is okay, because this means that you have tried it. that you have learned from it,that you make each other an experience richer. you get up again. you take your experience with you .you look at yourself. and you focus yourself. your next encounter. a new encounter and a promising future that lies ahead.</p>

            <p>maybe the beautiful moments were not enough to make the dark sides forget. but at that moments, what you needed was what filled you void,right or wrong. you loved the person because of his or her beautiful sides. the beautiful memories that you have built. and its okay to acknowledge that it might have been nothing more than a consolation. a dream,a memory, a relationship that did not meet your expoectations,a relationship in which you did not much, a good hope. with a painful outcome.</p>

            <p>It is okay to miss someone. miss someone who is not right for you,but at that moment gave you what you needed.maybe it was the words that touched you where you thought nobody understands you.maybe it was the touch that you cherished that way,the arm around you.the emptiness that was filled up.some one could talk to,someone who listened.maybe that person didn't understand you, maybe the void wasn't filled in the right way</p>
